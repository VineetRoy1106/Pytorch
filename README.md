## Introduction

In the competitive landscape of food delivery services, providing accurate delivery time estimates is crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This project leverages machine learning to predict food delivery times by analyzing historical data and various influencing factors.

## Features

- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using historical delivery data to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Single Prediction**: Estimate delivery time for individual orders based on specific input parameters.
- **Batch Prediction**: Process multiple orders simultaneously by uploading a CSV file to obtain delivery time predictions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **app.py**: Main application file containing routes for model training, single prediction, and batch prediction.
- **src/**: Directory containing source code modules for data processing, model training, and prediction pipelines.
- **templates/**: HTML templates for rendering web pages.
- **batch_prediction/Uploaded_CSV_FILE/**: Directory for storing uploaded CSV files for batch predictions.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-delivery-time-prediction.git
   cd food-delivery-time-prediction
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Define necessary environment variables, such as file paths and configuration settings.

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8888`.

### Model Training

- **Access the Training Page**:
  - Navigate to `http://localhost:8888/train`.
- **Initiate Training**:
  - Click the "Start Training" button to begin the model training process.
- **Monitor Progress**:
  - Training status and logs will be displayed on the page.

### Single Prediction

- **Access the Prediction Page**:
  - Navigate to `http://localhost:8888/predict`.
- **Enter Delivery Details**:
  - Fill in the form with the required delivery information.
- **Submit for Prediction**:
  - Click the "Predict" button to receive the estimated delivery time.

### Batch Prediction

- **Access the Batch Prediction Page**:
  - Navigate to `http://localhost:8888/batch`.
- **Upload CSV File**:
  - Click the "Choose File" button and select a CSV file containing multiple delivery records.
- **Submit for Batch Prediction**:
  - Click the "Upload and Predict" button to process the file and receive predictions.

**Note**: Ensure that the uploaded CSV files for batch prediction adhere to the required format and contain all necessary fields for accurate predictions.
